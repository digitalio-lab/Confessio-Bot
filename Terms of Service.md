## Terms of Service

### 1. Description of Service
Confessio Bot lets server members submit anonymous confessions that are posted to configured channels. While confessions appear anonymous to regular members, the Bot logs the confession author’s Discord user ID and username to a private log channel visible to server administrators for moderation and safety.

### 2. User Responsibilities
You must not use the Bot to:
- Violate Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
- Engage in harassment, hate speech, threats, or illegal activity.
- Spam or otherwise abuse the Bot's functionality.

Users acknowledge that confessions are anonymous to other members but visible to server admins in the configured log channel.

### 3. Administrator Responsibilities
Server administrators who install the Bot are responsible for:
- Proper configuration (including setting a private log channel visible only to authorized moderators).
- Moderating content submitted through the Bot per server rules and Discord policies.
- Using moderation tools (for example, /blockconfess) fairly.
- Notifying server members that confessions are logged and visible to the moderation team.

### 4. Premium Services
- Optional premium features are offered and processed via Ko-fi.
- Premium features are provided "as-is" and may change or be discontinued.
- Payments are handled by Ko-fi; by paying you agree to Ko-fi’s terms.

### 5. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Bot is provided "as-is" without warranties. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation or that the Bot will meet specific needs.

### 6. Limitation of Liability
We are not liable for content posted through the Bot or actions taken by users or administrators. In no event will we be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from using or being unable to use the Bot.

### 7. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the Bot at any time for any reason without prior notice. Server administrators may remove the Bot at any time by kicking it from their server.

### 8. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms occasionally. Significant changes will be announced. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
